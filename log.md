# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 25 2020 (Example 1)

**Today's Progress**: Started working on the data visualization course on Freecodecamp.
**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
